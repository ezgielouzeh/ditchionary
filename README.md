# Ditchionary
A simple react app to view books with options for the app to read the text in addition to show translations in Turkish.
This app was created as part of Stackathon within Grace Hopper Academy


## Start

Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database
